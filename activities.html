						<h1>INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT NASA`S ACTIVITIES IN NIGERIA</h1>
						<span>OCTOBER 4, 2020</span>
						<p>NASA had a station in Kano, Nigeria to help the Apollo mission's moon landing over 50 years ago.
						Most of the slides showed snapshots of the street life of Kano in the mid-1960s
						<br>
						"It took a little more time and some research to realize that we had stumbled onto a fascinating piece of history."
						<br>
						Most of the slides showed snapshots of the street life of Kano in the mid-1960s, but others drew our attention because they seemed to feature some sort of military base or communication station. The photographer’s notes provided the most important clue. On many slides, he had written: “GT-3” and “GT-4.”
						</p>
						<p>A bit of research told us that GT-3 and GT-4 were shorthand for two NASA missions in Project Gemini, which aimed to develop space travel techniques that would enable the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon. In 1964 and 1965 two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield. These were followed by ten flights with crews in 1965 and 1966.
							<br>
						GT-3, or “Gemini Titan 3,” was the third Gemini mission and the first crewed mission. It was launched in March 1965. GT-4, “Gemini Titan 4,” followed three months later in June 1965. It was the fourth Gemini mission and the first American spacewalk.
						<br>
						GT-3 and GT-4 were supported by the communications station we can now see thanks to the diligent record-keeping of a slide photographer.
